# 🌍 Open-Source Everything

📚 **My First Bitcoin** provides open-source Bitcoin education that is absolutely independent, impartial, and community-led.  

We operate both in El Salvador and on a global level – and have created a so-called [**Node Network**](https://myfirstbitcoin.io/node-network-dashboard/) of **64+ Bitcoin education projects** in **36+ countries** that use our resources.

## 📁 About This Repository  
### 🛠️ Open Tools for a Shared Mission

As part of our commitment to open-source principles, we're not building for ourselves – we're building for everyone and everywhere.  

We're openly sharing the tools, frameworks, and resources we've developed so that other organizations, educators, and communities can **learn, adapt, and scale their own impact** in Bitcoin education in their own communities worldwide.

💬 Because we believe in **collaboration over competition**.  
⚡ Competition is fiat. ₿ Bitcoin is a collaboration.

💡 That’s why we say: **Open Source Everything**.  

---

Together, we can create a future where Bitcoin knowledge is **freely available**, **community-led**, and **globally impactful**.  
🧱 One block at a time.  
👤 One individual at a time.  
🏘️ One community at a time.

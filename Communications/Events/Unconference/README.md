## 💡 The Idea of an Unconference
The idea of “unconference” is not new. Imagine a safe place where like-valued people gather, share ideas, go really deep brainstorming, and build their network. Here are some general references for inspiration:

- [Organize A Local BarCamp](http://barcamp.org/w/page/404135/OrganizeALocalBarCamp)
- [Unconference Methods](https://unconference.net/methods-2/)
- [Internet Identity Workshop](https://internetidentityworkshop.com/)
- [Identity Woman](https://identitywoman.net/)

## 📋 Planning References
In this folder, you will find examples. Some may be blank templates, and some files may be actual planning tools but with names and other personal information removed.

Examples include:
- Checklist-timeline tool
- Pro forma ticket-expense planner
- Sample communications to speaker applicants

It’s recommended to review past lessons learned. These are captured in after action review (AAR) notes, e.g., “Nashville 2024 Unconference AAR”.
